# Group Working Agreement

This document outlines a shared set of working principles for the
**FPGA-Wand project (Information Processing – Group 10)**.

The purpose of this agreement is not to enforce rules for their own sake,
but to help the group work effectively on a technically complex project
with shared deadlines, dependencies, and assessment requirements.

Clear expectations help reduce stress, avoid last-minute issues, and
ensure that everyone’s effort is treated fairly.

---

## 1. Task Ownership

Each task should have a clearly identified owner.

- The owner is responsible for seeing the task through to completion
- If difficulties arise, raising them early is encouraged
- Tasks may be adjusted or reassigned if needed to keep the project moving

This helps avoid confusion about responsibilities and ensures progress is visible.

---

## 2. Respecting Deadlines

Internal deadlines are set to support integration, testing, and preparation
for assessed components (e.g. demo, report, oral).

- Deadlines should be treated as meaningful
- If a deadline cannot be met, early communication is expected
- Repeated missed deadlines may require changes to task allocation

Deadlines exist to protect the group’s overall progress, not to add pressure.

## 3. Contribution Quality

Contributions should aim to be complete and usable by others.

- Code should run or be clearly documented
- Written material should be clear enough for teammates to rely on
- If something is only a draft or partial, this should be stated explicitly

This ensures that time spent integrating or reviewing work is not wasted.

---

## 4. Communication and Availability

Timely communication is important for coordination in a group project.

- Messages related to tasks or decisions should ideally be acknowledged
  within a reasonable timeframe (e.g. within a day)
- If someone expects to be unavailable for a period, a brief notice is helpful
- Important decisions should be confirmed rather than assumed

Good communication helps avoid misunderstandings and duplicated work.

---

## 5. Peer Feedback and Fairness

Peer feedback is part of the coursework and is intended to reflect actual
contributions over the duration of the project.

- Feedback will be based on delivered work and participation
- Situations where work is covered by others may be noted
- The aim is fairness and transparency, not criticism

This helps ensure that effort is recognised appropriately.

---

## Closing Note

This agreement is intended to support a positive and productive working
environment for everyone involved.

If any part of this document needs clarification or adjustment, it should
be discussed openly within the group.
